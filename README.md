## About this app

This is a tiny project using React to interact with [JSON Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) where user, as an admin, can do the following:
* View list of users
* View list of posts of each user
* View list of albums of each user
* View the detail of each post and its comment
* View list of photos from an album
* View the detail of photo
* Can add, edit and delete post 
* Can add, edit and delete comment 

## Libraries/Frameworks used

* React for view library
* Create React App for boilerplate
* React Router for routing
* Semantic-UI for CSS framework
* Styled Components for CSS-in-JS
* React Markdown for markdown rendering
* Axios for HTTP requests
* Redux for state management
* React-Redux for Redux's React bindings
* Jest and Enzyme for testing __(NOT FINISHED)__

## Additional Comments and Assumptions
* When doing POST requests (adding a new post or comment), the JSON Placeholder API will always return an object with id '101' and React will warn after adding post/comment two times that there's duplicated key on the list since I'm using post/comment id for the list key.
* After making a new post/comment and the user clicks on the new post/comment, nothing will be found since the new post/comment is not actually created.
* After editing a post, if you click on the post and go to the post page, the changes aren't reflected since the API doesn't actually change the data.
* I planned to use Jest and Enzyme for testing but I didn't have enough time before the due date.
* I didn't finish loading state feature because I didn't have enough time.
* I first made the app without any state management, and then quickly realized that I needed it because there's too many prop drilling and lifting state up/down and had to rewrite lots of the code and I haven't finished refactored the old code into using redux completely for state management
